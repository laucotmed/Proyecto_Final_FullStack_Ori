        <h1>Ori</h1>
        <p>Ori is the protagonist of the videogame Ori and the Blind Forest. A Spirit who becomes separated from their
          biological and adoptive family and is placed into a journey to save the forest of Nibel from a dangerous Decay
          spreading throughout the land. </p>
        <p>At the start of the game Ori is not very powerful at all. They can only perform basic functions such as
          running or jumping. But over the course of the game Ori accumulates a vast set of Skills and Abilities by
          learning the talents of other Spirits and becomes really powerful. </p>

        <p>When Ori became separated from the Spirit Tree during the Great Storm Naru discovered the young spirit and
          raised it as her own child. Naru is of an unknown race and Ori's effective "foster mother". Naru is very
          caring and affectionate especially towards Ori. She shares many personality traits with her parent and with
          the earlier days of Kuro who both loved and cherished their children. Naru is also shown to be very determined
          and selfless striving to find Ori even as Nibel was burning around her. </p>
